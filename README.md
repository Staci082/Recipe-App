# MERN Stack Recipe App



Welcome to the MERN Stack Recipe App, "Fiesta Flavors", a simple CRUD application for discovering, creating, and managing your favorite recipes. I started this project to practice the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack while building a useful application for managing recipes.

You can find the frontend in the Client branch and the backend in the Server branch.

You can try out Fiesta Flavors by visiting [here](fiesta-flavors.vercel.app).
