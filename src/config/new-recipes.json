If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week \u2013 as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture. As it contains raw eggs it shouldn\u2019t be given to anyone in an at-risk group, including pregnant women, the elderly, the unwell and the very young.
